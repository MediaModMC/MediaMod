### General
- Document your code, if creating a new class it is recommended that you start it like this:

/**
 * This is the main class for the ExampleMod
 * @author ConorTheDev
 */
public class ExampleMod {
  /**
   * Contains the URL required for the endpoint
   */
  public static final String aString = "url";
}
```
- Format your code, this can be done in IntelliJ by pressing CTRL + Alt + L (on Windows / Linux) or CMD + Alt + L (on macOS)
